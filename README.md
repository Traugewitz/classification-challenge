Module 13 ISP classification and supervised ML

In this module, we are pretending that we work at an Internet Service Provider with which we've been tasked  with improving the email filtering system for our customers.

We created two classificaton models to fit the provided data.  We evaluated which model was more accurate at detecting spam: The logistic regression model or the random forest model.

We then proceeded to train, test, split the data.  Fit, transform, and predict the data. Finally, we compared the two with the accuracy_score() method.
